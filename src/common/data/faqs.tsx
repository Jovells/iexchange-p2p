        After the initial appeal, a settler is invited to oversee the situation. The settler decides which party is not guilty by voting to either cancel or release the token. If either party does not agree they can opt for another appeal. An Appeal can happen 4 times max. If there is still a misunderstanding it will be open for the entire DAO to also make their decision. The majority decision of the DAO is final, 70% quorum with 75% majority is required, Settlers get rewarded & the reward is a fraction of the penalty. DAO gets rewarded if they end up participating & penalty is charged to the guilty party.
